DO NOT MERGE THIS README...

this is pulled from the merge/frontend-refactor branch and it currently has courses and slides view fixed.

the task for this story is:
For the implementation of the frontend story "Hide-student-edit-course-buttons-refactor-version" Go to frontend page CourseCard, Courses and do changes in there about the user role and user id from viewer.

Look at how veronica did the relay fetch on "frontend\src\components\course\CreateCourseModal.tsx" and then look at the similar way of the viewer sidebar "frontend\src\components\hocs\Sidebar\withSidebar.tsx"

the role: viewer is for the string of the current role the user is "Student" or "Admin" or "Instructor"

the id is that specific user. but it will not show what type of role that user ID is.


Note: will work on this later but the idea is currently in here in case I forget my idea when I come back to this.
