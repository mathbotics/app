# app
Monorepo for Mathbotics services.

Don't merge ReadMe. still in progress... Changes are Courses.tsx, Courseslist.tsx, CourseCard.tsx. The changes were creating new props User. and UserQuery in the Courses.tsx

currently crashes on line 61 in Courses.tsx. ... but hey I got the right type for user when passing it on to CoursesList and CourseCard (at least on IDE)...

The issue might be a runtime issue, possibly? idk...
